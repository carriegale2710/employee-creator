# Employee Creator Frontend / Client App

[![React S3 Deploy](https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator/actions/workflows/react-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator/actions/workflows/react-deploy.yml)

---

## Introduction

### Implementation: Front-end decisions

<!-- Why did you implement this the way you did? -->

- Used top-down TDD to define backend before connecting to frontend.
- Write up basic tests before coding to understand functionality, entity shapes & edge cases.

### Techstack

- React: SPA for responsive layout
- Typescript: validating forms for user input before being sent to DB saves time in both DX and UX.
- SCSS/Tailwind: For modular, reusable styles and themes based on design systems.

---

‚öíÔ∏è Setup

Follow these steps to run the React app locally using Vite + TypeScript:

1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator.git
cd employee-creator/front-end

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js v18+ installed.

npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the front-end folder:

touch .env

Inside .env, add:

VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

> üîê Note: All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the frontend code.

You can now access it in your React code using:

const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;


3. Run the Development Server

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

4. (Optional) Build for Production

npm run build

5. (Optional) Preview Production Build

npm run preview

## Testing

The app UI is pretty minimal and straightforward (just CRUD), so I will only test internals/implementation for now in order to speed up production.

More advanced testing like data and fetching should be abstracted to the backend, hence e2e and integration tests will be pushed back until more advanced features like signup/login flows are created.

FE testing will be more for ensuring correct validation/error handling on create/edit features in the Form component, as this is where most unexpected user inputs/interaction may occur.

### Running tests

Techstack used: Vitest + Zod

```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Approach

- Main Purpose: "Does the user interface act like it should when I use it?"

- TDD: write test, pass, refactor for each new feature/component. Avoid overbuilding before MVP.

- Component Tests: Good for testing individual functionality quickly.

Right now, testing public features only:

- What the user sees (rendering, UI)
- What the user does (onClick, onSubmit, onHover)
- What the user expects (data, nav, buttons)

| Test Type      | Example Test                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| UI rendering   | ‚ÄúForm loads with all fields‚Äù               |
| User flow      | ‚ÄúUser can submit form and see success msg‚Äù |
| Validation     | ‚ÄúShows error for empty email‚Äù              |
| Error handling | ‚ÄúShows message if server fails‚Äù            |

### Design Goals / QA Checklist

#### üíª Frontend MVP (React + TypeScript)

- [x] React app compiles and runs (Vite)
- [x] Basic CRUD employee functionality works
- [x] Form validation added
- [x] Optional testing included (Vitest/Zod)
- [x] UI styled + responsive (SCSS/Tailwind)

#### Core Flows

- [x] Page loads with correct data from backend (GET)
- [x] Form inputs accept user input
- [x] Form submits valid data successfully (POST/PATCH)
- [x] Item can be deleted (DELETE)
- [x] Navigation or redirects work after actions

#### Error Handling

- [x] Required fields show validation error if empty
- [x] Invalid input (e.g. bad email) is blocked
- [ ] Backend error (e.g. 400 or 500) shows helpful message
- [ ] Loading and error states show something visible (e.g. spinner or alert)

#### User Experience

- [x] Mobile/responsive layout works (test one small screen)
- [ ] Buttons and links are clickable and have visual feedback
- [x] Basic keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter)
- [x] No obvious visual glitches after user actions
- [ ] Toasts or alerts auto-dismiss after success

## Features

Note: \* = MVP (priority)

### User Stories

| ID  | Feature               | User Wants To...         | So They Can...            | User should be able to...                                                        |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `List Employees`      | \*See all employees      | Review records            | Click link to view a paginated list of all employee records                      |
| 2   | `Create Employee`     | \*Add a new employee     | Register new hire         | Click button that opens a form to add a new employee as a new record in DB       |
| 3   | `Delete Employee`     | \*Delete employee        | Remove old record         | Click a button to delete a record of an existing employee in DB                  |
| 4   | `Update Employee`     | \*Edit existing employee | Fix errors or update info | Click an edit button that opens a form pre-filled with data to update the record |
| 5   | `Find Employee by ID` | Search specific employee | View or confirm details   | Enter an ID in a search box and fetch/display the record if it exists            |

### üìÑ Contract Features Table

Each **employee can have multiple contracts**, and contracts are managed separately but linked to employees (like foreign key via `employeeId`).

| ID  | Feature                         | User Wants To...                    | So They Can...                 | User should be able to...                                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `List Contracts`                | See all contracts                   | Review records                 | Click link to view a paginated list of all contracts (with optional employee filter) |
| 2   | `Create Contract`               | \*Add a new contract                | Register new agreement         | Click button that opens a form to add a new contract linked to an employee           |
| 3   | `Delete Contract`               | Remove a contract                   | Get rid of outdated info       | Click a delete button to remove a contract from the DB                               |
| 4   | `Update Contract`               | Edit an existing contract           | Fix terms or extend a contract | Click an edit button to open a form with existing values and update the record       |
| 5   | `Find Contract by ID`           | \*View a specific contract          | Check specific terms/details   | Enter a contract ID to fetch and display its details                                 |
| 6   | `List Contracts by Employee ID` | \*View all contracts for 1 employee | Track one employee‚Äôs history   | Click from employee page to view all contracts linked to that employee               |

### React Code Structure

| File                   | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `employeeService.js`   | Handles raw API calls (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)           |
| `useEmployees.js`      | Manages local state + calls service + keeps list in sync |
| `EmployeeListPage.jsx` | Renders the list and uses the hook                       |
| `EmployeeForm.jsx`     | Reuses hook to trigger updates after submit              |

## Agile Board

### In progress

### Sprint



User flow

- validation with zod

### Backlog

Form validation

UI styling - Global styling (tailwind)

- install tailwind
- use tailwind play to preview designs before implementation
- gather and import any design system assets
- structure in index and partials/variables: color palette, typography
- delete any redundant scss files
