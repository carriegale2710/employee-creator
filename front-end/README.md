# Employee Creator Frontend / Client App

[![React S3 Deploy](https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator/actions/workflows/react-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator/actions/workflows/react-deploy.yml)

---

## Introduction

### Implementation: Front-end decisions

<!-- Why did you implement this the way you did? -->

- Used top-down TDD to define backend before connecting to frontend.
- Write up basic tests before coding to understand functionality, entity shapes & edge cases.
- Break up app into simplified components.
- Reuse the same presentational for component for both editing and creation functions.

### Techstack

- React: SPA for responsive layout
- Typescript: validating forms for user input before being sent to DB saves time in both DX and UX.
- SCSS/Tailwind: For modular, reusable styles and themes based on design systems.

‚öíÔ∏è Setup

Follow these steps to run the React app locally using Vite + TypeScript:

1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/carriegale2710/employee-creator.git
cd employee-creator/front-end

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js v18+ installed.

`npm install`

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the front-end folder:

`touch .env`

Inside .env, add:

`VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`

> üîê Note: All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE\_ to be accessible in the frontend code.

You can now access it in your React code using:

`const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;`

3. Run the Development Server

`npm run dev`

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

4. (Optional) Build for Production

`npm run build`

5. (Optional) Preview Production Build

`npm run preview`

---

## Testing

### Running tests

Techstack used: Vitest

```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Approach

- Main Purpose: "Does the user interface act like it should when I use it?"

- TDD: write test, pass, refactor for each new feature/component. Avoid overbuilding before MVP.

- Component Tests: Good for testing individual functionality quickly.

Right now, testing public features only:

- What the user sees (rendering, UI)
- What the user does (onClick, onSubmit, onHover)
- What the user expects (data, nav, buttons)

| Test Type      | Example Test                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| UI rendering   | ‚ÄúForm loads with all fields‚Äù               |
| User flow      | ‚ÄúUser can submit form and see success msg‚Äù |
| Validation     | ‚ÄúShows error for empty email‚Äù              |
| Error handling | ‚ÄúShows message if server fails‚Äù            |

### Design Goals / QA Checklist

#### üíª Frontend MVP (React + TypeScript)

- [x] React app compiles and runs (Vite)
- [x] Basic CRUD employee functionality works
- [x] Form validation added
- [x] Optional testing included (Vitest/Zod)
- [x] UI styled + responsive (SCSS/Tailwind)

#### Core Flows

- [x] Page loads with correct data from backend (GET)
- [x] Form inputs accept user input
- [x] Form submits valid data successfully (POST/PATCH)
- [x] Item can be deleted (DELETE)
- [x] Navigation or redirects work after actions

#### Error Handling

- [x] Required fields show validation error if empty
- [x] Invalid input (e.g. bad email) is blocked
- [ ] Backend error (e.g. 400 or 500) shows helpful message
- [ ] Loading and error states show something visible (e.g. spinner or alert)

#### User Experience

- [x] Mobile/responsive layout works (test one small screen)
- [ ] Buttons and links are clickable and have visual feedback
- [x] Basic keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter)
- [x] No obvious visual glitches after user actions
- [ ] Toasts or alerts auto-dismiss after success

## Features

Note: \* = MVP (priority)

### User Stories

| ID  | Feature               | User Wants To...         | So They Can...            | User should be able to...                                                        |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `List Employees`      | \*See all employees      | Review records            | Click link to view a paginated list of all employee records                      |
| 2   | `Create Employee`     | \*Add a new employee     | Register new hire         | Click button that opens a form to add a new employee as a new record in DB       |
| 3   | `Delete Employee`     | \*Delete employee        | Remove old record         | Click a button to delete a record of an existing employee in DB                  |
| 4   | `Update Employee`     | \*Edit existing employee | Fix errors or update info | Click an edit button that opens a form pre-filled with data to update the record |
| 5   | `Find Employee by ID` | Search specific employee | View or confirm details   | Enter an ID in a search box and fetch/display the record if it exists            |

### üìÑ Contract Features Table

Each **employee can have multiple contracts**, and contracts are managed separately but linked to employees (like foreign key via `employeeId`).

NOTE - Since contracts are legal documents, we don't want them to be mutable ie. no update contract function.

| ID  | Feature                         | User Wants To...                    | So They Can...               | User should be able to...                                                            |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `List Contracts`                | See all contracts                   | Review records               | Click link to view a paginated list of all contracts (with optional employee filter) |
| 2   | `Create Contract`               | \*Add a new contract                | Register new agreement       | Click button that opens a form to add a new contract linked to an employee           |
| 3   | `Delete Contract`               | Remove a contract                   | Get rid of outdated info     | Click a delete button to remove a contract from the DB                               |
| 4   | `Find Contract by ID`           | \*View a specific contract          | Check specific terms/details | Enter a contract ID to fetch and display its details                                 |
| 5   | `List Contracts by Employee ID` | \*View all contracts for 1 employee | Track one employee‚Äôs history | Click from employee page to view all contracts linked to that employee               |
