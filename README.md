## Introduction

### What it is

Employee Creator is a full-stack CRUD web app built with Java Spring Boot and React TypeScript. It allows users to manage employee records (add, view, edit, delete). The project demonstrates frontend/backend integration, RESTful API design, form validation, testing, and deployment.

### Why I built it

This project was created to practice building production-ready applications with testing, responsive UI, and scalable architecture. It also mirrors typical enterprise apps used in HR systems.

## Techstack and why

| Layer      | Technology                              | Why I chose it                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Backend    | Java, Spring Boot                       | Production-grade APIs, type safety  |
| DB         | MySQL, JPA                              | SQL schema control, ORM integration |
| Frontend   | React, TypeScript, Vite                 | SPA structure, compile-time safety  |
| Styling    | Tailwind (TBD) CSS / SCSS               | Component-level styling, responsive |
| Testing    | JUnit, Mockito, REST Assured, H2        | API e2e + unit tests, mock data     |
| Deployment | AWS EC2 (Backend API) S3 (Front-end UI) | Easy CI/CD, low costs               |

### Other notes

1. Backend:

   - Java: using OOP is ideal for defining Employee classes with interfaces - can be extended upon.
   - Spring: Easier to manage dependency injection and database updates for RESTful APIs.

2. Frontend:
   - React: SPA for responsive layout
   - Typescript: validating forms for user input before being sent to DB saves time in both DX and UX.
   - SCSS/Tailwind: For modular, reusable styles and themes based on design systems.

## Design Goals / Approach

### MVP Objectives

See [Project Requirements](project-brief.md)

- Build a full-stack app:
  - Backend: Spring Boot REST API (CRUD for employees)
  - Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Must be production-ready, testable, and deployed
- Include:

  - Basic validations
  - Responsive layout
  - Hosting (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

### TDD Workflow

| Phase       | Action                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| üî¥ Red      | Write a test for a feature you haven‚Äôt built yet |
| üü¢ Green    | Build the simplest code to pass the test         |
| üü° Refactor | Clean up code while keeping tests passing        |

<!-- ### Implementation

Why did you implement this the way you did? -->

---

## Backend Design Goals / Approach

<!-- Why did you implement this the way you did? -->

### Backend decisions

- Included a contracts and departments table with a `one-to-many relationship` for `employees -> contracts` and `departments -> contracts`
- This allows for flexible, quicker UX when updating of DB records via in FE client app with only minor updates eg. salary, contract dates etc.

### Front-end decisions

- Used top-down TDD to define backend before connecting to frontend.
- Write up basic tests before coding to understand functionality, entity shapes & edge cases.

### Features

## Known issues

<!-- Remaining bugs, things that have been left unfixed:

Features that are buggy / flimsy/not functional yet: -->

- Front-end app is not switching the VITE api key according to env (dev vs production mode).
- Duplicate data (for email) posting needs to return BAD_REQUEST status code.
- [14/07/25] Custom domain for EC2 : for fetching safely from front-end (otherwise error below)
  -> stuck at AWS security settings : health check failing, need to look at EC2 security group setting again

- [15/07/25] Need to audit API logging and react app fetching for any security holes

---

## Future Goals

<!-- What are the immediate features you'd add given more time / ideas parking lot: -->

Employees:

- [Employee Search Bar](employee/assets/diagrams/flows/Searchbar.md) with employee id or first/last name find by name match with query params)

Contracts:

- `Find all past Contracts of an Employee` | View all contracts for 1 employee | Track one employee‚Äôs history | Click from employee page to view all contracts linked to that employee |
- `Save a draft Contract` (incomplete form) | Edit an existing contract | Fix terms or extend a contract | Click an edit button to open a form with existing values and update the record |
- `Find all saved drafts of an Employee` | View all contracts for 1 employee | Track one employee‚Äôs history | Click from employee page to view all contracts linked to that employee |

Other:

- Add API Pagination (with findAll(Pageable pageable) from JpaRepository)
- Login and authentication service/security (for admin access only) - Context API for frontend?

---

## Learning & Challenges

- Setting up **GitHub Actions** was tricky‚Äîrequired many commits to get configs right.
- Deployment went smoothly, but linking backend & frontend on AWS EC2 with a custom domain took some tweaking of security settings.
- Maintaining TDD was a challenge under a tight deadline.  Found a middle ground of implementing tests after testing in browser to be more rewarding due to lack of specifications - made writing tests first difficult. 

## What I Learned

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

- Writing end-to-end backend tests helped clarify features and edge cases.
- Seeing tests pass was motivating and boosted momentum.
- Reduced time spent debugging during refactors by catching issues early.

**Pros:**  
- Defined project scope early  
- Increased confidence with regression tests  
- Motivation from green test ticks  

**Cons:**  
- Slowed me down as project grew  
- Felt like overkill for small features  

### Documentation Strategy

- Mini progress updates in README proved better than Trello for solo work:
  - Easier version control  
  - Helps track scope creep and blockers  
  - Refreshes context after breaks  

### Git & Workflow

- Using **main** + **dev** branches mimicked team workflows ‚Äî great for practicing merges and resolving conflicts.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD and testing was challenging but rewarding.
- Branching felt a bit overkill for solo work but valuable practice for team projects.
