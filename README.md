## Introduction

### What it is:

Employee Creator is a full-stack CRUD web app built with Java Spring Boot and React TypeScript. It allows users to manage employee records (add, view, edit, delete). The project demonstrates frontend/backend integration, RESTful API design, form validation, testing, and deployment.

### Why I built it:

This project was created to practice building production-ready applications with testing, responsive UI, and scalable architecture. It also mirrors typical enterprise apps used in HR systems.

## Demo & Snippets

- [ ] Include hosted link: TBA
- [ ] Include images of app if CLI or Client App

//TODO - (replace with own finished front-end UI upon completion)

### Feature 1: Employee List

(TBA)

### Feature 2: New Employee Form

(TBA)

## Techstack and why

| Layer      | Technology                   | Why I chose it                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Backend    | Java, Spring Boot, JPA       | Production-grade APIs, type safety  |
| DB         | MySQL, JPA                   | SQL schema control, ORM integration |
| Frontend   | React, TypeScript, Vite      | SPA structure, compile-time safety  |
| Styling    | Tailwind CSS / SCSS          | Component-level styling, responsive |
| Testing    | JUnit, Mockito, REST Assured | API + unit testing                  |
| Deployment | Heroku (TBD)                 | Easy CI/CD                          |

### Other notes:

1. Backend:

   - Java: using OOP is ideal for defining Employee classes with interfaces - can be extended upon.
   - Spring: Easier to manage dependency injection and database updates for RESTful APIs.

2. Frontend:
   - React: SPA for responsive layout
   - Typescript: validating forms for user input before being sent to DB saves time in both DX and UX.
   - SCSS/Tailwind: For modular, reusable styles and themes based on design systems.

## Design Goals / Approach

### Overview:

- Build a full-stack app:
  - Backend: Spring Boot REST API (CRUD for employees)
  - Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Must be production-ready, testable, and deployed
- Include:

  - Basic validations
  - Responsive layout
  - Hosting (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

### QA Checklist

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend: | - App compiles and runs (Spring Boot)<br>- API has 3 working CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)<br>- Unit/e2e tests run and pass ( J-Unit, Mockito)<br>- Error handling exists<br>- Logging strategy in place ( )                                                                               |

| Delivery | - README includes setup steps to compile and run the API and the Web app in localhost.<br>- Hosting link works (Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.)<br>- Code is clean and documented.<br>- Production ready.<br>- Understandable and maintainable by other developers.<br>- Bug free, compiles and work. |

### Implementation

Why did you implement this the way you did?

- Used enum for department to enforce consistency.
- Used top-down TDD to define backend before connecting to frontend.
  - Write up basic tests before coding to understand functionality, entity shapes & edge cases.
- Used Tailwind for quick responsive UI with minimal setup.

### App Layers: (update later)

![layers](assets/data/app-service-layers.png)
![service-design](assets/refs/layer-example.png)

## Schemas

### Employee Schema

Data types for properties of Employee class.

- id : unique number (generated in backend)
- first_name : string
- last_name : string
- email : unique string (generated in backend)
- department : enum (dropdown in UI)
- startDate : Date (datepicker UI, validation needed)

### Employee List - Sample Data (GET Request)

This is what the Employee List Data should look like when fetched from API.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Timmy",
    "lastName": "Turner",
    "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
    "department": "ENGINEERING",
    "startDate": "2023-01-10"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "firstName": "Cosmo",
    "lastName": "Cosma",
    "email": "cosmo@example.com",
    "department": "HUMAN_RESOURCES",
    "startDate": "2020-08-15"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "firstName": "Wanda",
    "lastName": "Fairywinkle",
    "email": "wanda@example.com",
    "department": "SALES",
    "startDate": "2019-04-22"
  }
]
```

### CreateEmployeeDTO Schema

This is the type of data that will be sent from the client side. Note: A unique Id & email should be generated in backend

- first_name : string
- last_name : string
- department : enum (dropdown in UI)
- startDate : Date (datepicker UI, validation needed)

Note: üîí "department" must be one of:
"ENGINEERING", "SALES", "HUMAN_RESOURCES", "MARKETING", "FINANCE"

### Sample Data for POST Request

```json
{
  "firstName": "Timmy",
  "lastName": "Turner",
  "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
  "department": "ENGINEERING",
  "startDate": "2023-01-10"
}
```

### SQL Schema - Database

```sql
-- Define enum type
CREATE TYPE department AS ENUM (
  'ENGINEERING',
  'SALES',
  'HUMAN_RESOURCES',
  'MARKETING',
  'FINANCE'
);

-- Table using enum
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  department department NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL
);
```

## Project Brief

### Purpose

Demonstrates an understanding of:

- writing RESTful APIs with basic CRUD endpoints
- building front-end UIs with React
- integration of backend + frontend code
- deployment of full-stack web applications

### MVP Requirements

[Project Brief](https://github.com/nology-tech/aus-post-course-guide/tree/main/projects/employee-creator)

- We need a web application to manage employees:
  - [ ] create
  - [ ] list
  - [ ] modify
  - [ ] delete
- The schema for the employee is left to the criteria of the candidate.

Also code should be:

- [ ] Production ready.
- [ ] Understandable and maintainable by other developers.
- [ ] Robust and handle error situations.
- [ ] Bug free, compile and work.
- [ ] Include instructions to compile and run the API and the Web app in localhost.
- [ ] Hosting (Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.) is required.
- [ ] If your code includes unit tests you may use a unit test framework of your choice.

### Hints

#### React hints

- React Redux is recommended.
  - You may want to use a Redux middlewear like thunks or epics to handle async actions
- Typescript is recommended.
- React hooks are recommended.
- You can include any other open source NPM library.
- Feel free to use your favorite CSS framework.
  - Tailwind is a good choice
- Feel free to use your favorite middleware.
- Add some basic validations on the form like:
  - [ ] input required
  - [ ] input max length
- Reccomended:
  - [ ] React Hook Form
  - [ ] Zod are reccomended
- The site should be responsive.
  - [ ] media queries
  - [ ] flexbox

#### RESTful API hints

- The list can be a local database
  - [x] MySQL is reccomended
- Implementing an API logging strategy.
  - [ ] Log2j **highly** reccomended
- [ ] Implementing error handling strategy.
- At least 3 endpoints are required:
  - [ ] To create an employee `/create`
  - [ ] To get a list of existing employees `/list`
  - [ ] To delete an employee `delete?id={id}`
