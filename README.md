## Introduction

### What it is

Employee Creator is a full-stack CRUD web app built with Java Spring Boot and React TypeScript. It allows users to manage employee records (add, view, edit, delete). The project demonstrates frontend/backend integration, RESTful API design, form validation, testing, and deployment.

### Why I built it

This project was created to practice building production-ready applications with testing, responsive UI, and scalable architecture. It also mirrors typical enterprise apps used in HR systems.

## Techstack and why

| Layer      | Technology                              | Why I chose it                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Backend    | Java, Spring Boot                       | Production-grade APIs, type safety  |
| DB         | MySQL, JPA                              | SQL schema control, ORM integration |
| Frontend   | React, TypeScript, Vite                 | SPA structure, compile-time safety  |
| Styling    | Tailwind (TBD) CSS / SCSS               | Component-level styling, responsive |
| Testing    | JUnit, Mockito, REST Assured, H2        | API e2e + unit tests, mock data     |
| Deployment | AWS EC2 (Backend API) S3 (Front-end UI) | Easy CI/CD, low costs               |

### Other notes

1. Backend:

   - Java: using OOP is ideal for defining Employee classes with interfaces - can be extended upon.
   - Spring: Easier to manage dependency injection and database updates for RESTful APIs.

2. Frontend:
   - React: SPA for responsive layout
   - Typescript: validating forms for user input before being sent to DB saves time in both DX and UX.
   - SCSS/Tailwind: For modular, reusable styles and themes based on design systems.

## Design Goals / Approach

### MVP Objectives

See [Project Requirements](project-brief.md)

- Build a full-stack app:
  - Backend: Spring Boot REST API (CRUD for employees)
  - Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Must be production-ready, testable, and deployed
- Include:

  - Basic validations
  - Responsive layout
  - Hosting (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

### TDD Workflow

| Phase       | Action                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| üî¥ Red      | Write a test for a feature you haven‚Äôt built yet |
| üü¢ Green    | Build the simplest code to pass the test         |
| üü° Refactor | Clean up code while keeping tests passing        |

### Production Protocol

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "main"
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    commit id: "setup project"

    %% Feature branches
    branch feature/create-employee
    checkout feature/create-employee
    commit id: "Add backend API"
    commit id: "Add frontend form"
    checkout dev
    merge feature/create-employee

    branch feature/edit-employee
    checkout feature/edit-employee
    commit id: "Update backend logic"
    commit id: "Update frontend UI"
    checkout dev
    merge feature/edit-employee

    %% Hybrid long-lived branches for refactors
    branch refactor/frontend-rewrite
    checkout refactor/frontend-rewrite
    commit id: "Rewrite UI structure"
    checkout dev
    merge refactor/frontend-rewrite

    branch refactor/backend-cleanup

    commit id: "Refactor controller logic"
    checkout dev

## Known issues

<!-- Remaining bugs, things that have been left unfixed:

Features that are buggy / flimsy/not functional yet: -->

1. Delete by employee id not working in BE.
2. Front-end app is not switching the VITE api key according to env (dev vs production mode).
3. Duplicate data (for email) posting needs to return BAD_REQUEST status code.
4. [14/07/25] Custom domain for EC2 : for fetching safely from front-end (otherwise error below)
   -> stuck at "Test out your API" : health check failing, need to look at EC2 security group setting again

5. [15/07/25] Need to audit API logging and react app fetching for any security holes

---

## Future Goals

<!-- What are the immediate features you'd add given more time / ideas parking lot: -->

- Add API Pagination (with findAll(Pageable pageable) from JpaRepository)
- Contracts: Implement a contracts table schema, with a one-to-many relationship with each employee (one employee can have many contracts)

Maybes:

- Search Bar (find by name match with query params)
- Login and authentication service/security (for admin access only) - Context API for frontend?

---

## Learning Curves + Research Questions

<!-- - What did you struggle with? What? Why? How? -->

- Setting up Github Actions was a bit tricky in terms of config. Too many commits to test it.
- Deployment was straight forward but linking up BE with FE a bit tricky with setting up AWS security settings for custom domain for EC2 server hosting

## Retrospective: Lessons + skills learnt from this project

### Practicing Test Driven Development (TDD)

- Writing E2E tests for my backend API was super helpful for understanding what exactly my features were.
- Also helped with motivation seeing green ticks.
- Better efficiency with regression testing during refactors rather than debugging in browser.

### Experimenting with more efficient, sustainable project documentation strategies (eg. change logs, mermaid diagrams).

- I have found that writing a few notes on your progress helped A LOT with project scope definition/creep. Also just better understanding what the project brief is about and thinking earlier about what potential blockers to beware of during production.
- Before I was using trello before, which was good but not as sustainable for more solo dev work (good for collaboration though). - I have found just writing mini-progress reports in a README file to be simpler and even safer way due to better version history. I don't need to worry about accidently deleting anything as I can go back to older commits.
- I can also track progress changes overtime, and refresh my brain on what I was working on the day before.
- Will continue using this method for solo projects.
