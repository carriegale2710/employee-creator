### Running the App Locally (macOS & Windows)

---

#### üê¨ 1. Install MySQL

- **macOS**

  ```bash
  brew install mysql
  brew services start mysql
  ```

- **Windows**

  1. Download [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
  2. Install MySQL Server
  3. Make sure it's running as a service

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Create Database

Open MySQL shell:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Then run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

> ‚úÖ **Skip user creation if you're using `root` for local dev**
> Otherwise:
>
> ```sql
> CREATE USER 'your_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
> ```

---

#### üìÑ 3. Add `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_NAME=your_database_name
MYSQL_USER=your_user_or_root
MYSQL_PASS=your_password
```

---

#### üßØ 4. Fix Socket Errors [macOS Only]

If you get MySQL socket errors on Mac, force TCP:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/${DB_NAME}
```

---

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run the App

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or use your IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.)

---

### Endpoints:

Once running, your API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Opening this in your browser should return "Hello, world".
Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or a browser (for GET requests) to test.

- **GET all employees:**
  `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`

- **GET single employee:**
  `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}`

- **POST new employee:**

  - Method: `POST`
  - URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`
  - Body (JSON):

    ```json
    {
      "firstName": "Timmy",
      "lastName": "Turner",
      "email": "timmy@fairy.com"
    }
    ```

## Testing

| Type       | Tools Used       | Status |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Unit Tests | JUnit + Mockito  | ‚úÖ     |
| E2E Tests  | REST Assured, H2 | ‚è≥     |

```bash
./mvnw test      # backend

```

## Backend Design Goals / Approach

### Backend decisions

- Included a contracts and departments table with a `one-to-many relationship` for `employees -> contracts` and `departments -> contracts`
- This allows for flexible, quicker UX when editing of DB records via in FE client app with only minor updates eg. salary, contract dates etc.

## Database structure

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### Summary

| What                       | Relationship            | Why we did this                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Employees table**        | Has personal info only  | Department can change ‚Üí so not stored here                         |
| **Contracts table**        | Has job info per period | Stores department, salary, hours, type, dates for each role/period |
| **Departments table**      | Lookup table            | Keeps department names unique and consistent                       |
| **Employee ‚Üí Contracts**   | One-to-Many             | - Each employee can have multiple contracts over time              |
| **Department ‚Üí Contracts** | One-to-Many             | Each contract is tied to one department at that time               |

<!-- - In `Employee`:`@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")`
- In `Contract`:`@ManyToOne`
- In `Contract`:`@ManyToOne`
- In `Department`:`@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")` (optional) -->

---

### Schemas

#### Employee Schema

Basic employee personal data ‚Äî no department or job info here (now handled via `contracts` and `departments`).

```ts
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  address?: string;
}
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Timmy",
  "lastName": "Turner",
  "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "0400000000",
  "address": "123 Fairy Lane"
}
```

---

#### Contract Schema

Each employee can have multiple contracts across different time periods and departments.

```ts
interface Contract {
  id: number;
  employeeId: number;
  departmentId?: number;
  contractType: "FULL_TIME" | "PART_TIME";
  salaryAmount?: number;
  hoursPerWeek?: number;
  startDate: string; // ISO date string
  endDate?: string; // ISO date string or null
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "employeeId": 1,
  "departmentId": 1,
  "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
  "salaryAmount": 80000,
  "hoursPerWeek": 38,
  "startDate": "2023-01-10",
  "endDate": null,
  "isActive": true
}
```

---

#### Department Schema

Lookup table to keep departments consistent but flexible to be updated later.

```ts
interface Department {
  id: number;
  name: "ENGINEERING" | "SALES" | "HUMAN_RESOURCES" | "MARKETING" | "FINANCE";
}
```

JSON HTTP 'PUT' Request:

```json
{
  "id": 1, //not needed if "POST" request (creation)
  "name": "ENGINEERING"
}
```

---

### Sample Employee List Response (GET `/employees`)

Joining the employee with their current contract and department for display.

- Can clean up HTTP response to exclude sensitive information for security.

JSON HTTP Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Timmy",
    "lastName": "Turner",
    "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
    "currentContract": {
      //virtual field
      "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
      "startDate": "2023-01-10",
      "department": "ENGINEERING"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "firstName": "Cosmo",
    "lastName": "Cosma",
    "email": "cosmo@example.com",
    "currentContract": {
      //virtual field
      "contractType": "PART_TIME",
      "startDate": "2022-04-12",
      "department": "HUMAN_RESOURCES"
    }
  }
]
```

---

### DTO Schemas

#### CreateEmployeeDTO + CreateContractDTO (opt.)

When creating a new employee with an option for initial contract:

```ts
interface CreateEmployeeDTO {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  // email: string; get backend to generate
  phoneNumber: string;
  address?: string;
  contract?: ContractDTO; //opt.
}
interface CreateContractDTO {
  departmentId: number; //get this from name
  contractType: "FULL_TIME" | "PART_TIME";
  startDate: string; // ISO date string
  salaryAmount?: number;
  hoursPerWeek?: number;
}
```

AS `POST` HTTP request (JSON):

```json
{
  "firstName": "Timmy",
  "lastName": "Turner",
  "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "0400000000",
  "currentContract": {
    "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
    "startDate": "2023-01-10",
    "department": "ENGINEERING"
  }
}
```

#### EditEmployeeDTO

When editing personal details of existing employee.

- As `POST` HTTP request to update only email (JSON):

```json
{
  "employee_id": 11, //required
  "email": "timmy_turner@example.com"
}
```

#### EditContractDTO

When editing personal details of existing contract.

- As `POST` HTTP request to update only salary in employee's contract (JSON):

```json
{
  "employee_id": 11, //required
  "contract_id": 101, //required
  "salaryAmount": 85000
}
```

### API Endpoints

| ID  | Method   | Endpoint         | Input             | Output Data | Success Response |
| --- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | `GET`    | `/employees`     | none              | DB List     | `200 OK`         |
| 2   | `POST`   | `/employees`     | CreateEmployeeDTO | DB Record   | `201 Created`    |
| 3   | `DELETE` | `/employees/:id` | employee id       | No Content  | `204 No Content` |
| 1   | `GET`    | `/employees/:id` | employee id       | DB Record   | `200 OK`         |

### 08/07/2025 - Basic CRUD endpoints + Writing tests

Created endpoints for:

- `GET` `/employees` = [DB -> list (of records)]
- `GET` `/employees/{id}` = [DB -> record]
- `POST` `/employees` = [DB + record]
- `DELETE` `/employee/{id}` = [DB - record]

API Test Setup:

- Fixed Github workflows for automated testing (see badges at top)
- Outlined e2e test cases and edges for new all endpoints
