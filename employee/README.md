| `employee/README.md` (this file)                | ‚öôÔ∏è Backend-specific setup, API docs, DB, test config.   |
| [`front-end/README.md`](../front-end/README.md) | üé® Frontend-specific setup, dev commands, tests         |

## Build Steps - Backend Setup

<!-- - how to build / run project
- use proper code snippets if there are any commands to run -->

### Installation + Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-creator.git
cd employee-creator

# Backend setup
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

```

### Running the App Locally (macOS & Windows)

---

#### üê¨ 1. Install MySQL

- **macOS**

  ```bash
  brew install mysql
  brew services start mysql
  ```

- **Windows**

  1. Download [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
  2. Install MySQL Server
  3. Make sure it's running as a service

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Create Database

Open MySQL shell:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Then run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

> ‚úÖ **Skip user creation if you're using `root` for local dev**
> Otherwise:
>
> ```sql
> CREATE USER 'your_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
> ```

---

#### üìÑ 3. Add `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_NAME=your_database_name
MYSQL_USER=your_user_or_root
MYSQL_PASS=your_password
```

---

#### üßØ 4. Fix Socket Errors [macOS Only]

If you get MySQL socket errors on Mac, force TCP:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/${DB_NAME}
```

---

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run the App

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or use your IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.)

---

### Endpoints

Once running, your API will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Opening this in your browser should return "Hello, world".
Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or a browser (for GET requests) to test.

- **GET all employees:**
  `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`

- **GET single employee:**
  `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/{id}`

- **POST new employee:**

  - Method: `POST`
  - URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`
  - Body (JSON):

    ```json
    {
      "firstName": "Timmy",
      "lastName": "Turner",
      "email": "timmy@fairy.com"
    }
    ```

## Testing

| Type       | Tools Used       | Status |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Unit Tests | JUnit + Mockito  | ‚úÖ     |
| E2E Tests  | REST Assured, H2 | ‚è≥     |

```bash
./mvnw test      # backend

```

## Backend Design Goals / Approach

### Backend decisions

- Included a contracts and departments table with a `one-to-many relationship` for `employees -> contracts` and `departments -> contracts`
- This allows for flexible, quicker UX when updating of DB records via in FE client app with only minor updates eg. salary, contract dates etc.
- Schema, with a one-to-many relationship with each employee (one employee can have many contracts)

## Features

### API Endpoints

| ID  | Method   | Endpoint         | Input                           | Output Data | Success Response |
| --- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | `GET`    | `/employees`     | none                            | DB List     | `200 OK`         |
| 2   | `GET`    | `/employees/:id` | employee id                     | DB List     | `200 OK`         |
| 3   | `POST`   | `/employees`     | createEmployeeDTO               | DB Record   | `201 Created`    |
| 4   | `DELETE` | `/employees/:id` | employee id                     | No Content  | `204 No Content` |
| 5   | `PATCH`  | `/employees/:id` | employee id + updateEmployeeDTO | DB Record   | `200 OK`         |

### Sample Employee List Response (GET `/employees`)

Joining the employee with their current contract and department for display.

JSON HTTP Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Timmy",
    "lastName": "Turner",
    "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
    "currentContract": {
      //virtual field
      "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
      "startDate": "2023-01-10",
      "department": "ENGINEERING"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "firstName": "Cosmo",
    "lastName": "Cosma",
    "email": "cosmo@example.com",
    "currentContract": {
      //virtual field
      "contractType": "PART_TIME",

### Schemas

#### Employee Schema

Basic employee personal data ‚Äî no department or job info here (now handled via `contracts` and `departments`).

```ts
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone?: string;
  address?: string;
}
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Timmy",
  "lastName": "Turner",
  "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
  "phone": "0400000000",
  "address": "123 Fairy Lane"
}
```

---

#### Contract Schema

Each employee can have multiple contracts across different time periods and departments.

```ts
interface Contract {
  id: number;
  employee: Employee;
  department?: string; //
  contractType: string; //eg. "FULL_TIME" | "PART_TIME";
  salaryAmount?: number;
  hoursPerWeek?: number;
  startDate: string; // ISO date string
  endDate?: string; // ISO date string or null
  isActive: boolean; //virtual field
}
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "employee": timmyTurner,
  "department": "Talent",
  "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
  "salaryAmount": 80000,
  "hoursPerWeek": 38,
  "startDate": "2023-01-10",
  "endDate": null,
  "isActive": true //virtual field
}
```

#### Department Schema

Lookup table to keep departments consistent but flexible to be updated later.

```ts
interface Department {
  id: number;
  name: "ENGINEERING" | "SALES" | "HUMAN_RESOURCES" | "MARKETING" | "FINANCE";
}
```

JSON HTTP 'PATCH' Request:

```json
{
  "id": 1, //not needed if "POST" request (creation)
  "name": "ENGINEERING"
}
```

---

### DTO Schemas

#### CreateEmployeeDTO

When creating a new employee with an option for initial contract:

```ts
interface CreateEmployeeDTO {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string; //get backend to generate if empty?
  phone: string;
  address?: string;
  contract?: ContractDTO; //opt.
}
```

AS `POST` HTTP request (JSON):

```json
{
  "firstName": "Timmy",
  "lastName": "Turner",
  "email": "timmehhh@example.com",
  "phone": "0400000000",
  "currentContract": CreateContractDTO //opt
}
```

#### UpdateEmployeeDTO

When updating personal details of existing employee.

- As `PATCH` HTTP request to update only inputed fields (JSON):

```json
{
  "firstName": "Timmy", //opt.
  "lastName": "Turner", //opt.
  "email": "timmy_turner@example.com" //opt.
  "phone": "0400000000", //opt.
}
```

#### CreateContractDTO

```ts
interface CreateContractDTO {
  departmentId: number; //get this from name
  contractType: "FULL_TIME" | "PART_TIME";
  startDate: string; // ISO date string
  salaryAmount?: number;
  hoursPerWeek?: number;
}
```

```json
{
  "contractType": "FULL_TIME",
  "startDate": "2023-01-10",
  "department": "ENGINEERING"
}
```

#### UpdateContractDTO (bonus)

When updating personal details of existing contract.

- As `PATCH` HTTP request to update only salary in employee's contract (JSON):

```json
{
  "employee_id": 11, //required
  "contract_id": 101, //required
  "salaryAmount": 85000
}
```

- Installs Rest Assured Library for writing automated test that send requests during testing.
- Adds records for e2e test setup using H2 database for mocking with dummy data
  - Creates basic test for `getAll()`
- test badges update - Github actions

### 08/07/2025 - Basic CRUD endpoints + Writing tests

Created endpoints for:

- `GET` `/employees` = [DB -> list (of records)]
- `GET` `/employees/{id}` = [DB -> record]
- `POST` `/employees` = [DB + record]
- `DELETE` `/employee/{id}` = [DB - record]

API Test Setup:

- Fixed Github workflows for automated testing (see badges at top)
- Outlined e2e test cases and edges for new all endpoints
- Fixed application.properties config bug for test suite
- Created config folder for ModelMapper library - easier to create new entities compared to manual setters

### 12/07/2025 - Custom Domain for API

- Created new healthcheck controller endpoint for testing load balancer

- Bought custom domain from porkbun - to be implemented:
- Started: Auto-deployment workflow for Spring App EC2 Deployment (not working yet) (on hold)

### 14/07/2025 - API Logging

- API logging strategy:
  - implemented SLF4J facade in EmployeeApplication controller class
  - created dev profile for console and file log formats and level filtering
  - configured SLF4J to use Log4j2 instead of default (Logback)
  - created log4j2-spring.xml for log configuration and formatting, with dev profile

### 19/07/2025 - Error handling

- went back and introduced error handling for backend API

`Delete employee record`:

- Return `BAD REQUEST` if wrong input - fixed, passing
- Return `NO_CONTENT` on successful deletion - fixed, passing

`Create employee record`:

- Return `BAD REQUEST` if invalid first/last name - passing
- Return `BAD REQUEST` if invalid duplicate email - passing

### 20/07/2025

- Extended employee entity to have more fields (phone number, address)

Edit employee feature:

- updateById PATCH method : used TDD - wrote tests + function in parallel
- (DONE) pass 2x e2e tests for UpdateEmployeeByIdTests :
  (passing individually but not when whole test runs)
  - valid update - getting 404
  - dealing with duplicate emails - getting 404

Contracts feature : (one-to-many relationship: employee can have multiple contracts)

- used employee feature structure as a base to speed things up
- e2e + service tests done
